# Welcome

Memory Mint is a FREE flashcard application which can be run natively in your browser.

# Why I Created Memory Mint

Memory Mint was created as a free alternative to applications such as Quizlet. Our competitors are increasingly raising their 
prices, while removing options from their free verions. I hope to bring a majority of these features to the public, promising to 
never charge you directly. 

>[!NOTE]
>This application will never _directly_ charge you, however this service was developed for free and thus usages of the
>__chatgpt__ api and others will accrue api tokens, thus indirectly costing you. I will provide alternative options, such as 
>self hosting the LLM, however these will be added later.
