# Welcome

Memory Mint is a FREE flashcard application that can be run natively in your browser.

# Why I Created Memory Mint

Memory Mint was created as a free alternative to applications such as Quizlet. Our competitors are increasingly raising their 
prices while removing options from their free versions. I hope to bring most of these features to the public, promising never to charge you directly. 


>[!NOTE]
>This application will never _directly_ charge you, however, this service was developed for free and thus usage of the
>__ChatGPT__ API and others will accrue API tokens, thus indirectly costing you. I will provide alternative options, such as 
> self-hosting the LLM, however, these will be added later.
