## Backend (Air)
Air provides hot-reloading capabilities for Go applications during development:
- Monitors file changes in real-time
- Automatically rebuilds and restarts the server
- Reduces development cycle time
- Ideal for rapid prototyping and testing

## Frontend (Vite)
Vite offers fast hot module replacement (HMR):
- Instant updates when files are modified
- No manual refresh required
- Preserves application state during updates
- Optimized for modern development workflows

## Benefits for Forking
This automatic change detection allows:
- Quick experimentation with code changes
- Immediate feedback on modifications
- Easier project customization
- Seamless development experience when creating project forks
